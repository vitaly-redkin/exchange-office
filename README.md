This project is a simple front-end for the Currency Exchange Office.

The project is a React application created with the create-react-app (CRA) script so all usual shell commands are available to run the application:

- `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

**Warning: the project has no unit tests save for a "smoke test" created by the CRA. The main reason for this is a lack of compatibility between Jest/Enzyme and Typescript 3.0 as per moment of writing.**
